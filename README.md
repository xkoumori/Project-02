The purpose of this project is to apply coding skills to picking up low-level scripting skills in Git-Bash terminal using the text editor nano.
Used https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners to follow the steps for this project.
Overall everything was working properly step by step as the bash scripting tutorial.
I had a lot of problems with executing the backup.sh properly.
Sent out an email to Git Hub link to my partner as well around 9:30 am on Oct. 4, 2020.

- I did not add the cal command in the task.sh because cal command does not work.
- Used nano instead of vi for all of my shell files.
- Simple Backup Bash Shell Script:
	- I was able to do the simple ls command to backup hello-world.
	- I was unable to run backup.sh.
- Variables:
	- was able to execute welcome.sh properly.
	- was unable to execute backup.sh properly.
- Functions was executed properly, except for backup.sh.
- Numeric and String Comparisons was executed properly.
- Conditional Statements was executed properly.
	- Changed file directory for home, but backup.sh still wasn't working properly.
- Positional Parameters was executed properly,
	- backup.sh came back as a failed backup, and shows that total_archived_files command was not found.
- For Loop was executed properly.
- While Loop was executed properly.

	- backup.sh came back as a failed backup, and shows that total_archived_files command was not found.
