The purpose of this project is to apply coding skills to picking up low-level scripting skills in Git-Bash terminal using the text editor nano.
Used https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners to follow the steps for this project.
Overall everything was working properly step by step as the bash scripting tutorial.
I had a lot of problems with executing the backup.sh properly.
Sent out an email to Git Hub link to my partner as well around 9:30 am on Oct. 4, 2020.

- I did not add the cal command in the task.sh because cal command does not work.
- Used nano instead of vi for all of my shell files.
- Simple Backup Bash Shell Script:
	- I was able to do the simple ls command to backup hello-world.
	- I was unable to run backup.sh.
- Variables:
	- was able to execute welcome.sh properly.
	- was unable to execute backup.sh properly.
- Functions was executed properly, except for backup.sh.
- Numeric and String Comparisons was executed properly.
- Conditional Statements was executed properly.
	- Changed file directory for home, but backup.sh still wasn't working properly.
- Positional Parameters was executed properly,
	- backup.sh came back as a failed backup, and shows that total_archived_files command was not found.
- For Loop was executed properly.
- While Loop was executed properly.
- Until loop was executed properly, but backup.sh wasn't working properly.
	- backup.sh came back as a failed backup, and shows that total_archived_files command was not found.

Code Review (Dylan)
Your code was done very well. it is formatted in a way that is easy to read. All of your indents, spaces, and brackets were well done. I did not see any errors in your code while reviewing it. 
It looks like you are missing the "for" code block. That is the only negative aspect about your code, everything lese looked fine to me.
